# React + Vite

This is an interactive web project. Chef app, recipes, api call to AI, etc

## Notes

My project notes.

1. Props
The 'props' refers to the properties that are passed into a component in order 
for it to render correctly. This is similar to how a function receives parameters. 
Note - A component receving props is not allowed to modify them. In other words, props are "immutable" 

2. Fiedlset & legend
The recomended way to group form items.

3. Try Bootstrap
Styling the radio, checkboxes are challenging. Bootstrap works easily, but it impacts other elements.
If imported globally it tries to style every other component. (probably selecting by element types)
ToDo: Figure out a way to locally import Bootstrap in a component level.

Next steps: Try to read inputs from Signup form, continue the course.
